- This project focuses on processing Yelp dataset obtained from Yelp Academic Dataset using Databricks platform. The objective is to transform raw JSON data into queryable datasets, perform data cleansing, and address various business queries provided by the Data Analytics (DA) team.
- The project utilizes Databricks to process the following Yelp Academic Dataset JSON files:

yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
yelp_academic_dataset_checkin.json
yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
yelp_academic_dataset_tip.json
yelp_academic_dataset_user.json
Data processing involves uploading the data into Databricks File System (DBFS), flattening the JSON data, joining sub-sources into a unified table, dropping unnecessary columns, and performing data cleansing. Business queries such as the number of reviews per business, distribution of businesses across states and cities, and review timings are addressed.
